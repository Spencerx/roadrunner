Roadrunner
====================

Roadrunner is a job flow executor. You can submit a job flow (in the form of a json file) to Roadrunner and it will run the jobs in the order given in the flow and return the status and output to the contact person via email.

Example use case:
1. Deploy code to all the api hosts and if the job succeeds, then deploy to all the frontend hosts.
2. scp some files from certain hosts to a central host and if that succeeds on atleast 80% of the hosts, then run a consolidation script on the central host having all the copied files.
